### kleindl 
A small deep learning framework. Working on this because I want to get into the systems programming for ml applications and need to a frontend/tensor lib to write accelerators and such for. 

#### Todo
- benchmarking script (FLOPS)
- read papers/implement them (adam, dropout, batchnorm)
- ane & cuda accelerators
- graph visualization feature
- run llama and other open source models
- line count script (keep minimal)
